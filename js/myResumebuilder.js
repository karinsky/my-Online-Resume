/* The 'bio object' (1)
(adding to the 'bigpic', 'featured', and 'footer' sections)*/

/*The project specifications demand that we need to build four
JSON objects and that each one needs to follow the provides schemas
exactly. My objects comply -- but the specifications do not demand
to actually use all object elements [properties?] in the display
function.
My project is based on the assumption that the header section and
the core of the 'bigpic' section stay the same while other content
can be swapt in js. On this line, it seemed forced and artificial
to write code which would 'swap in' my name, role, and biopic.
In the same time, I believe, my project makes up for such 'chores'
by adding more functionality to the main resume parts which, in
my project, are added to the 'featured' section.*/

/*the education object (to 'id item1' ?):
Preface on my German education:
a) The structure and degrees in the German educational system
   are not directly comparable to the American system, i.e.
   I do not have completed majors, though I have a PhD.
   Thus it took me some time to figure out the particular
   meaning of "degree" and "major" in Udacity's setup of
   properties for the 'education object'. As to my mind, I still
   completed a section of my education with a degree, I use
   the "major" property to designate a 'department/program'
   framework for the degree with which I left the educational
   institution.
b) A PhD in Germany did not require attending a program, and
   there was no formal start date. Anyway, a PhD is usually
   listed just with the year of it's accomplishment. In order
   to stick to an overall style, though, I add the month in
   'dates'.
A last remark: Young people may still include days in the
'dates' of their resumes. Later on, no one cares on which day
exactly someone started or finished schools or jobs 20 years
ago. Thus, 'month/year' is a common resume formate for 'dates'.*/
